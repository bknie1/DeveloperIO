# Maintainable CSS w/ Max

## What makes CSS maintainable?
- Separate: Refactoring shouldn't break other elements.
- Modular: Reusable.
- Scalable: Increasing a codebase doesn't make maintaining CSS harder.

## Why care?
- Saves time wasted on bugs in fragile CSS.
- Boosts profit: More time devoted to other features.

## Rules
### Do
- Use consistent, clean spacing.
- Use variables and mixins for dry code.
  - Mixins: Chunks of reusable functionality.
    - e.g. SASS variables.
    - Opportunities for conditionals: If light, use dark. Else, use light.
- Make sure less supported styles have a fallback for older browsers.
- Write responsive CSS based on content, not devices.

### Don't
- ... use IDs for styling; use classes and elements!
  - No exceptions. Specificity hell.
- ... Nest selectors more than 2 selectors in.
- ... pair element with class selectors.
- ... go overboard with linting.
- ... make separate styles and layouts for specific mobile devices.

### Larger Rules
#### !important
Use important for styles you know you won't want to change, not styles you need to override. This probably doesn't happen too often.

#### CSS Ordering
Order CSS properties by logical grouping! More readable and more important than alpha or other standards.

#### Progressive Enhancement
1. Write simpler styles that get the job done.
2. Add nicer, more advanced CSS for supporting browsers.

```css
.gallery {
  ...
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  .gallery {
    ...
  }
}
```

## ITCSS: Inverted Triangle CSS Folder Structure
We can use pre-processors to bring different partials together.

### Inverted Triangle \\/

Broader, more general, larger CSS partials at the top:

1. Settings
  - Values and variables.
2. Tools
  - Mixins and functions.
3. Generic
  - High-level, global styles.
4. Elements
  - Native HTML elements.
5. Objects
  - Non-visual CSS patterns.
6. Components
  - Custom patterns and elements.
7. Trumps
  - Highly specific overrides, utility classes.

This inverted triangle structure is best maintained with a pre-processor like SASS or anything that lets you break your CSS into manageable partials.

You can adjust names/parts as long as the specificity and narrowing focus apply.

### Perks
1. Gives starting CSS architecture for newcomers. Great for thinking about CSS.
2. Helps prevents specificity issues and accidental styling.
3. Know where to add new classes.
  - For new and old elements.
4. Prevents large building of partials in certain folders.
  - Components will likely be crowded though.

## Questions
- Overboard with linting? Opinion.
  - CSShint annoyed that I don't alpha everything.
  - Breaks the lawful good alignment rules.
  - A mix of logical and alpha?
  - Max's Linting Rules? Favorite linter?
    - Hound
    - Any linter you can customize!
    - Adjusting logic.
