# JavaScript Fundamentals w/ Brady

## Compiled or Interpreted?

Not interpreted nor compiled. It does kick off at run time but it does compile into an abstract object tree.

## Lexical Scope
Means that where something is written defines its scope.

e.g. If you need to access a global deep in a function, the request will bubble up the function, to the outer function, to wherever that global lives. The middle functions don't know about the global, but they know 'who to ask' about it.

## Execution Context
JavaScript attempts to execute written code.

Components:
  - Local variable environment: Defines the potential actions.
  - Thread of execution: Where the work happens.

  Encapsulates work:

  output = multiply(3);

  Outer: Output is waiting for the op to complete. Creates an inner context to do that op (multiply(3)).

## Closure
A very important concept. A way to create state that is internally available to a function. Safe to track/use internal state.

The ability of a function to remember and use variables defined in their lexical scope when executed in a different lexical scope.

Consequence of two key features:
  - Functions as first class objects.
  - Lexical Scope

```js
function createCounter() {
  var counter = 0;
  function increment() {
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
  }
  return increment;

  // We return increment outside of the context of our original function. We don't reset counter!
}
//---------------------------------
var firstCounter=createCounter();
var secondCounter = createCounter();

firstCounter();
firstCounter();
secondCounter();
firstCounter();
secondCounter();
secondCounter();
```
